scalaz-scalatest
================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bwmcadams/scalaz-scalatest.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bwmcadams/scalaz-scalatest)

Scalatest bindings for scalaz.

Partially inspired by scalaz-specs2.

## Setting Up

We currently cross build for Scala 2.10.4 and 2.11.4 â€“ the CI system validates us against OpenJDK 6, Open & Oracle JDK 7s, and Oracle JDK 8.

We are working on migrating the package into the `org.typelevel` space but for now releases are only on bintary.
